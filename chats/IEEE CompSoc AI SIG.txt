What do we do in today's project evaluation
?
Hey guys, so we have Project evaluation today, starting in the evening around 7 30


For project evaluation, to show what we've done yet, I have created a presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z_P1WoZtCQNxLj95nqFAJisBH2B75rWKJr4PQ5iYoUw/edit?usp=sharing



In the slides regarding the KSSs, fill your respective slide with two-three points of what you spoke on. 


We'll meet later in the evening for project evaluation, exact time I'll let you know, depending on what slot we get.
But me and Arvind didn't get to do our kss..... Shall we just fill in what we thought we would do?
Yeah, do that
Okay..👍🏻
